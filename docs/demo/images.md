# Image Support

Contour implements first-class [Sixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel) image support.

Most notably supporting libraries,
are [notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/)
and [libsixel](https://github.com/libsixel/libsixel/).

Also, libsixel does provide a CLI to convert well known image formats (like PNG)
to Sixel format and have them printed to the terminal.
