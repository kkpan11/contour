# Unicode Core

We implement the [Terminal Unicode Core](https://github.com/contour-terminal/terminal-unicode-core) specification,
which addresses some of the problems terminals usually have when it comes to Unicode.

This mainly addresses complex grapheme cluster handling, variation selectors (VS15, VS16) handling, and its cursor placement.

Right-to-left (RTL) text is explicitly not handled in this extension.

Please follow up on the specification here: [https://github.com/contour-terminal/terminal-unicode-core](https://github.com/contour-terminal/terminal-unicode-core)
